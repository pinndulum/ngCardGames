                        A project I like to build when learning a new technology is Solitare. For this interation, typescript and Angular were my targets.
                        The <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes">Tour of Heroes application and tutorial</a> is a wonderful
                        guide and provided many useful tips.

                        <b>JM Card Games</b> provides interfaces and classes that can form the basis for most table top games. From Uno
                        to Texas Hold'em a programmer is limited only be their imagination. In theory, these games could include any tile
                        type game as well from dominoes to mahjong.

                    <p>
                        A close look at the source code reveals my solution for shuffling a deck of cards. Rather than iterating each
                        card in a deck and replacing it with another random card in the deck, I implementd what I believe to be a much
                        simpler solution. First every card is assigned a GUID (globaly unique identifier) that is then used to sort the
                        deck. The shuffle method includes a parameter that directs how many times this process should occur. Simulating
                        how a person would repeat their shuffle multile times before dealing.

                    <h3 class="card-header">52! (factorial)</h3>
                    <p>
                        With 52 cards in a deck, the total possible combinations of shuffled cards would equal <i>52!</i> (52 factorial
                        or 52 x 51 x 50 x 49...), or <i>8.06e+67</i>. This is a MASIVE number, so massive that most people would have a
                        horrible time understanding the sheer and utter enormity of it. Here is one explanation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given <b>500 Billion galaxies</b> in the universe with <b>200 Billion solar systems</b> in each galaxy and
                        <b>1 Billion planets</b> in each solar system and <b>10 Billion sentient beings</b> on each planet; If it were
                        possible for every one of those beings to
                        shuffle cards in pure random fashion <b>1 Million times per second</b> since the <b>BEGINNING OF TIME</b>, every
                        possible combination of shuffled cards would <b>still have not been found</b>!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It should be noted that these numbers are hypothetical and are not accurate, except for the number of solar
                        systems and galaxies in the universe. Obviously, there are NOT 1 billion planets in every solar system. It is
                        also obvious that every planet does not contain 10 billion people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Corrected numbers (or science's best estimates) on average, every star has at least 1 planet, to be more than
                        fair we'll go ahead and assume 2 planets per solar system. For this thought experiment let's just simply ignore
                        that each of those planets can't possibly be inhabited and go on believing that there are in fact 10 Billion
                        people on each world. We'll also be assuming that an average human can shuffle a deck of cards in approximately 5
                        seconds and so can our imaginary life forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That would be about <i>1.58e+50</i> total card shuffles since the beginning of time. In actuality this represents
                        <i>1/50,800,000,000,000,000,000th</i> of 52!. So, the prior explanation is <i>50 Quintilian times more than</i>
                        the quote scientifically corrected numbers.
